# SelfLearningMouse

Assignment from college.  
Mouse who will learn over time what moves to make to get the cheese in a maze.

## choose map

comment both hard maps out or both easy maps

## setup for mouse's intelligence

lambda will be the chance to choose random move rather than a "smart" move  

alpha will lower the chance of lambda everytime, which will make the mouse more likely to make a decision on which way to move over more attempts as he gets "smarter"  




## At the start of the main method:

choose either to makeZeroMapValues which will restart the mouse's intelligence  
OR  
choose readMapValues which will continue the mouse's intelligence from the previous runs in a row without restarting
